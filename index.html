<html>
    <body>
        The HTML content goes here.
    </body>
</html>

You may notice two copies of the HTML tag, and two copies of the body tag. We call these the _opening_ and _closing_ tags. Let's look at the same code, but include a little explanation.

* `<html>` is the opening HTML tag
* `<body>` is the opening body tag
* `</body>` is the closing body tag
* `</html>` is the closing HTML tag
